                    <p>The cheetah is the world's fastest land mammal. With acceleration that would leave most automobiles in the dust!</p>
                            <p>A cheetah can go from 0 to 60 miles an hour in only three seconds.</p>
                            <p>Whaaaaaaa! That's crazy!</p>
                    <p>The name cheetah comes from the Sanskrit word "chitraka," which means "the spotted one," according to the World Wildlife Fund.</p>
                            <p>But...ut they are wimps when it comes to defending a kill, relinquishing too easily to bigger, better predators like lions and hyenas.</p>
